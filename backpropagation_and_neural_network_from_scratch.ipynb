Instead of connecting every input to every neuron, CNNs use **local connections** and **shared weights** (the same pattern detector is applied across the entire input).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Why revolutionary:** Transformers can process entire sequences in parallel (unlike RNNs which process one step at a time), making them much faster to train. They also handle long-range dependencies better than RNNs, enabling models to understand context across entire documents.\n",

        "## Training - What Does It Mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, we pass many input values (one at a time) to the neural network. For each input value (also called a **training step**), each neuron in the first layer computes its output. The second layer receives the first layer's outputs as its inputs and computes its own outputs. This process continues through all layers until we get the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we pass the numeric representation of the word \"Hello,\" and as output we get the numeric representation of \"sdnsdbj.\" Let's say we wanted the neural network to output \"World\" instead of \"sdnsdbj.\" We don't just want correct output for this single input—we want the neural network to produce meaningful outputs for many inputs, such as Hello → World, My → Name, etc.\n",

        "### How Do We Achieve This?\n",
        "\n",

        "If we can do both of these for the neural network for a large set of inputs, we'll end up with a system whose model parameters have been updated (learned) to produce outputs very close to what we want. **This is called training.**\n",

        "\n",
        "## How Close Are the Prediction and Target?\n",
        "\n",
        "The **prediction** is what the neural network outputs, and the **target** is what we want. Between the words \"World\" and \"sdnsdbj,\" there's no intuitive way to measure how close they are directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's use numeric predictions for intuition. Suppose the network predicted 5 and we wanted 67. The prediction is 62 units away from the target. In another example, the prediction is 34 and the target is 38—here the prediction is only 4 units away from the target. We can say the network did a better job in the latter case.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For words, the situation is more nuanced.** Neural networks ultimately work with numbers, not text. Both the prediction and target must be represented numerically. There are sophisticated methods to convert words into numeric representations (called **embeddings**) that capture meaning—for example, the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" would have similar numeric representations, while \"cat\" and \"car\" would be different. Once words are represented numerically, we can measure similarity using mathematical distance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll explore how these word representations work in a later section. For now, the key principle is: **we need a way to measure how far our prediction is from the target**, whether dealing with numbers, words, or other types of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This distance between the prediction and target is called **loss**.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Mechanism to Update Model Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we **have a loss value**—a number indicating how far the prediction is from the target—we can update the model parameters in a way that reduces the loss. This step is formally called **optimization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "From input through neural layers to output, we performed simple mathematical computations. Crucially, all these computations are **differentiable** (we can compute their derivatives). This property is essential for what comes next.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Gradient Descent\n",
        "\n",
        "For each model parameter (let's call it `param_i`), if we can compute its **gradient**—that is, `dloss/dparam_i` (how much the loss changes when `param_i` changes)—then we can update the parameter by a small amount:\n",

        "- If `dloss/dparam_i` is positive → increasing `param_i` increases loss → so we *decrease* `param_i`\n",
        "- If `dloss/dparam_i` is negative → increasing `param_i` decreases loss → so we *increase* `param_i` (subtracting a negative = adding)\n",

Forget about learning semantic meaning in words or patterns in images; it can't even learn to predict values of a simple quadratic function, no matter how large the network is, how many parameters it has, or how much training it receives—because it's fundamentally linear at its core.\n",

        "1. **Activation level:** The output indicates how activated the neuron is for the given input.\n",

        "2. **Non-linearity:** The non-linear nature enables the neural network to learn complex patterns. Note: Learning simply means updating the model parameters so the network can predict outputs while accounting for complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Gradient properties:** Not only is the activation important, but also the gradient (derivative). If an activation function's derivative is nearly zero (a flat horizontal line) for most input values, it's a poor choice—especially for deep neural networks. This is because gradients are accumulated through multiplication across layers during backpropagation. Multiplying near-zero gradients causes gradients to vanish in earlier layers. Since gradients enable parameters to learn, vanishing gradients mean parameters can no longer learn, defeating the purpose of neural networks.\n",

        "### 1. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formulas:**\n",
        "- **Formula 1:** `tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))`\n",
        "- **Formula 2:** `tanh(x) = (1 - e^(-2x)) / (1 + e^(-2x))`  \n",
        "  *Note: This formula is numerically stable for positive x (e^(-2x) stays small), but for large negative x values, e^(-2x) can overflow. For production code, use library implementations (like numpy.tanh) or a sign-based approach that handles both cases safely.*\n",
        "- **Formula 3:** `tanh(x) = sinh(x) / cosh(x)`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bounds:** (-1, 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Behavior:**\n",
        "- Most activity occurs for |x| < 2, where values change from approximately -1 to +1\n",
        "- For |x| > 3, the function is nearly saturated—even for very large x values, tanh(x) changes very little\n",
        "- In other words, the derivative (gradient) is near zero in the saturation zone where |x| > 3\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem for deep networks:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This saturation is a significant issue in deep neural networks (though less problematic for shallow networks). During backpropagation, gradients flow from the loss to the output layer, then through layer_n down to layer_1. The chain rule requires multiplying gradients at each layer. When gradients are near zero (which happens for |x| > 3), these multiplications make gradients even smaller, eventually causing them to vanish.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:** If gradients are zero, parameters cannot learn—which defeats our main goal. The network can get stuck in saturation zones where gradients move very slowly with each training iteration.\n",

        "**Behavior:**\n",
        "- Most activity occurs for |x| < 5\n",
        "- For |x| > 6, the function is nearly saturated—very close to 0 for negative x and very close to 1 for positive x\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)\n",

        "- Common choice for most neural networks, including many LLMs\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it works well:**\n",
        "- Gradient is 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0 (undefined at exactly x = 0, but this is handled in practice)\n",
        "- For positive inputs, gradient = 1 prevents vanishing gradient problems (no multiplication by values < 1)\n",

        "- Simple and computationally efficient\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Formula:** `GELU(x) = x × Φ(x)`  \n",
        "where Φ(x) is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n",

        "**Characteristics:**\n",
        "- GELU is a smooth, probabilistic version of ReLU that gates inputs based on how likely they are to be \"large\" under a Gaussian (normal) distribution\n",
        "- Similar to ReLU, positive x values pass through the activation\n",
        "- Unlike ReLU, it doesn't arbitrarily cut off negative values—there's a smooth transition at x = 0\n",
        "- For small negative values, neurons aren't fully disabled (minimum output ≈ -0.17)\n",
        "- No sharp corners (differentiable everywhere)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Popularity:** GELU is increasingly popular in modern architectures. GPT, BERT, and most modern transformers use GELU. In current state-of-the-art models, GELU is often preferred over ReLU.\n",

        "## Understanding Embeddings and Batched Computation\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we dive into more advanced non-linear components, let's clarify how neural networks actually process text and multiple inputs simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "### From Words to Numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural networks don't work directly with words—they work with numbers. Each word is represented as an **embedding vector**—a list of floating-point numbers that captures the word's meaning. If our embedding dimension is `d_model` (say, 512), then each word becomes a vector of 512 floats.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight:** Words with similar meanings have similar embedding vectors. For example, \"cat\" and \"dog\" would have embeddings closer to each other than \"cat\" and \"car.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Processing Multiple Words\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, we don't pass one word at a time—we pass sequences of words. If we pass k words (where k ≤ max_context_length), we're actually passing a `k × d_model` matrix to the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How neurons process this:**\n",
        "- Each neuron still holds just a `d_model`-length weight vector\n",
        "- To compute the weighted sum, we perform: `(k × d_model) @ (d_model × 1)` → `k × 1` output\n",
        "- Each word's computation is independent—weighted sums for different words don't interfere with each other\n",
        "- We compute them in a single matrix multiplication to leverage GPU tensor cores for parallel processing\n",
        "\n",
        "After computing these `k × 1` outputs, we apply the activation function to each value independently—the activation doesn't mix information between different positions in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "This independence is important to understand because it contrasts with other mechanisms we'll discuss next, which *do* mix information across positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Softmax: Mixing Information Across Positions\n",
        "\n",
        "While activation functions operate independently on each neuron's output, there are other non-linear transformations that intentionally mix information. The most important example is **softmax**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Softmax formula:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "softmax(x_i) = e^(x_i) / Σ(e^(x_j)) for all j\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key property:** Softmax converts a vector of arbitrary values into a probability distribution—all outputs are between 0 and 1, and they sum to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Where it's used:**\n",
        "- In the attention mechanisms of transformers—the revolutionary component that made modern LLMs possible. We'll dive deep into this mechanism in a dedicated notebook.\n",
        "- At the output layer for classification tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it differs from activation functions:**\n",
        "- Activation functions process each value independently\n",
        "- Softmax uses *all* values in the vector to compute each output\n",
        "- Each final output value is influenced by all input values\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters for attention:** In transformer models, softmax is crucial for the attention mechanism. It helps the network decide which parts of the input sequence are most relevant for processing the current position. We'll see exactly how this works when we build attention layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Layer Normalization: Stabilizing Across Neurons\n",
        "\n",
        "Layer normalization is another non-linear operation, but it works differently from both activation functions and softmax.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "If a layer has 4 neurons that output: `[1.0, -0.5, 2.0, -1.0]`, layer normalization transforms these values to `[0.52, -0.87, 1.39, -1.04]` so that:\n",
        "- Their mean becomes 0\n",
        "- Their standard deviation becomes 1\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "LayerNorm(x) = γ × (x - μ) / σ + β\n",
        "```\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- μ is the mean of all neurons in the layer\n",
        "- σ is the standard deviation\n",
        "- γ (gamma) and β (beta) are learnable scale and shift parameters\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Batch normalization is conceptually similar to layer normalization, but it normalizes across a different dimension—across the **batch** rather than across the layer's neurons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it does:**\n",
        "Instead of normalizing across all neurons in a layer for a single example, batch normalization normalizes each feature (neuron) across all examples in the batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we have a batch of 32 images and a layer with 128 neurons:\n",
        "- **Layer Norm:** For each image, normalize the 128 neuron values\n",
        "- **Batch Norm:** For each neuron, normalize its values across the 32 images\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "BatchNorm(x) = γ × (x - μ_batch) / σ_batch + β\n",
        "```\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- μ_batch is the mean of this feature across all examples in the batch\n",
        "- σ_batch is the standard deviation across the batch\n",
        "- γ (gamma) and β (beta) are learnable scale and shift parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- Stabilizes training by reducing internal covariate shift\n",
        "- Allows higher learning rates\n",
        "- Acts as a form of regularization\n",
        "- Can reduce sensitivity to weight initialization\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it works better for images:**\n",
        "Batch normalization is extremely popular in computer vision models (CNNs like ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.) and performs remarkably well. This is likely because:\n",
        "- Even completely different images share low-level visual features (edges, corners, textures, color distributions)\n",
        "- These shared statistical properties make it meaningful to normalize across different images\n",
        "- The assumption that features should have similar distributions across examples holds reasonably well\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it's NOT common in LLMs:**\n",
        "Batch normalization is rarely used in modern language models and transformers. Here's why:\n",
        "- Text sequences in a batch are typically **unrelated**—different sentences have completely different content\n",
        "- Normalizing \"the\" in one sentence with \"quantum\" in another doesn't make semantic sense\n",
        "- Unlike images that share low-level visual patterns, text sequences don't share meaningful statistical properties just because they're in the same batch\n",
        "- **Variable sequence lengths** make batch normalization awkward to implement\n",
        "- Layer normalization works better because it normalizes within a single sequence, where the features are actually related\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Insight:**\n",
        "The effectiveness of normalization depends on whether examples in your batch share meaningful statistical properties:\n",
        "- **Images:** Yes → Batch norm works great\n",
        "- **Text:** No → Layer norm is preferred\n",
        "- **Tabular data:** Depends on the problem\n",

Why? We don't need to compute gradients for inputs because the input is not part of the neural network and it changes. Thus, changing inputs to reduce loss doesn't make sense. Similarly, since static values can't be changed, there's no point in computing gradients for them.\n",

If we set them to zero, then all the neurons of the entire network will be identical and thus they will identical things, and thus each neuron will be same.. representing same feature. Instead if they are randomly initialized, then each neuron learns something new.. some different complext pattern.. lots of differnt features.\n",
